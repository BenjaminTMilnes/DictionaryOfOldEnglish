Line 1: the language name

This is either 'OE' for 'Old English' or 'ME' for 'Modern English'. Hypothetically, at some point in the future, other languages that are related to Old English could be included in the dictionary.

Line 2: the part of speech

| str. masc. n. | Strong Masculine Noun |

Line 3: the entry text

References

Each entry can have a list of references, showing where the data for the entry came from.

```
ref. OET 2017/08/23
```

Reference lines start with ref., and are then followed by the reference name, which is a short tag used to identify the reference in a bibliography file, and then the date on which the data was retrieved from that source.

```
ref. <reference name> <date of retrieval>
```
